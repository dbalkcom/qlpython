# Computing with Python

Doing mathematical computations with Python, and storing the results.



## Expressions
You can use Python to compute. Anywhere a value is needed, you can use an *expression* that first computes the value. Like this:

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-output]
print(42)
print(19 + 24)
```

Click *show code cell output* to see the result. `19 + 23` is an expression. Python computes the value of the expression, 43, and then uses that value 43 as the parameter to the `print` function cacll.

The plus sign `+` is called an *operator*. You can also multiply, divide, or subtract:

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-output]
print(9 * 2 - 24/4)
```

The operator `*` multiplies, `-` subtracts, and `/` divides. Sometimes division will give you a decimal number, which we call a *floating point*. 

## Exercise: rectangle area
