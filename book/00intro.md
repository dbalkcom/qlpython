# A beginner's guide to coding

## What you'll need
You'll need a way to edit and run Python files. I use the `VScode` editor and the `miniconda` Python distribution, both of which are available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. You'll also need the `pygame` library installed with Python. 

A teacher or experienced friend can help you get these set up, or you can get plenty of help online. For example, you can ask a chatbot like ChatGPT or Gemini something like: "I'm running Windows. How should I install VScode and miniconda with pygame in the base environment?"
